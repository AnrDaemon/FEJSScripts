A simple repository to hold JS Scripts shared by the community
Additions should be in the form [groupname]/[jsname]/[version]/index.js
Type Script and Multifile scripts are currently not supported but might be added in the futre.
An index.properties file should also be maintained in your groupname to map script names to descriptions
In addition a versions.properties file must be maintained at the jsname level.

The contents of this file must be the follows:
Latest=Latest Version Released
Recommended=Recommended Version
Versions=A comma seperated list of all versions

Lastly, An Optional Readme file can be maintained both on a groupname level and a jsname level to provide information to the user about that unit.
